# React + Vite


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Using This Simulator
- I highly reccomend using just the integrated AI option. The non-ai format is too limited, and quite clunky in its experience.
- This program is quite simple, and we do not save your API keys. It purely for your sake.
- That being said, due to its simplicity, there may be some security issues I have to work on later on. Use your API keys at your own risk and discretion. Preferably free ones.
- For a free usable api key, I reccomend going to groq, navigating to https://console.groq.com/keys and generating a free api key to use.
- When doing so, make sure you select the "llama-3.1-8b-instant" which references the free api key you've created.
- As always, remember to never share your api key to anyone, and to save it into something you know you'll go back to. Like a notepad.
